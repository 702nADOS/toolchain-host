Requirements
============
The following packages must be installed:
>=sys-devel/gcc-4.7
>=dev-util/cmake-2.8.12
dev-libs/libxml2
Multithreading support must be available for mkevals.

If you want to build the API documentation, additionally the following
packages are required:
app-doc/doxygen


Installation
============

$ cd build
$ ../build-local.sh ..
$ make
$ make install

Installs all binaries to build/bin

If you like to perform a system-wide installation, you can simply used
'cmake' instead of 'build-local.sh'. Currently, we recommend to
perform only a local (non system-wide) installation.
